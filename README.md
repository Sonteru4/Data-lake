# Project - Data Lake
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we will build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. We will load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. We will deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.
